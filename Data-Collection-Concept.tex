	However, these devices do not come completely free of burden as they are fragile and deserve to be taken care of with alot of caution.\\
	Life being unpredictable as it is can result into accidents leading to damage of these devices which results in a standstill of the user's day-to-day activities.\linebreak
	
	Thus the reason for accessible people with the skills and knowledge to do these repairs as quick and conveniently as possible.\linebreak
	
	
	\textbf{Purpose}\linebreak
	The intended purpose for this document is to provide instructions to guide collection of information about users essentially customers with faulty electronic devices and provide them with the most efficient repairs in as less time as possible.\\
	A user friendly, easy-to-fill electronic form designed with a few basic fields such as names and age of the user, image of the faulty device and their own description of what they think the problem could be which is optional but is recommended for a quicker diagnosis of the problem.\linebreak
	
	This study will also help in determining what devices get the most issues and what devices future mechanics for lack of a better word can choose to venture in for example whether to concentrate more on phone repairs, television repairs and the like.\linebreak
